# Building-several-Regression-MachineLearning-Algorithms-for-ContinuousOutcomePrediction

This repository focuses on builing several Regression Models with Continuous Outome that predicts the House Price as part of Kaggle Competition

Competition lik can be found below:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

Code for building several Regression Models can be found in the Notebook "Regression-ML Models- House Prices.ipynb". The datasets used for train/validate the models is included in the repository

# Regression Models built in the code:

Model 1: Linear Regression

Model 2: Ridge Regression Model

Model 3: Lasso Regression Model

Model 4: XG Boost Regressor

Model 5: Polynomial Regression (with 2 degrees of feature interaction)
